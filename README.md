# mlrepl
A fork of the NodeJS repl that runs evals against a MarkLogic server instead of the built-in node server.

## Setup:
```javascript
node install.js
```

## Run
```javascript
node playground.js
```

## Play with the editor
```javascript
cd editor
bower install
node server.js
```
The browser should open automatically when you start the server.
